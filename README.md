# Welcome to My (latest) Portfolio

This is the latest iteration of my web portfolio, this time built with Gatsby.js. 

This is my third iteration of my portfolio. Every iteration has reflected my interest at the time. A few years ago, I was very interested in Laravel, so I built up my portfolio as a CMS, in Laravel. Laravel features elegant code, but building a site as a full-blown CMS, was time-consuming to say the least. 

Django was much easier. A few commands and you have an admin panel, and its `MV*` structure is somewhat less verbose than the MVC structure in Laravel. 

However, both were difficult to maintain and, especially, to build up a system to write content as easily as, say, Wordpress. Even in Markdown. 

My big goal this year is to start writing, about web development, tech generally and, eventually, AI. I also want to focus more on front-end development and front-end technologies/UI generally. Gatsby seemed perfect for this. I like writing in Markdown, and the idea of just loading and linking to my content in a folder seemed very attractive, compared to configuring Markdown editors with plugins (which often go out of date, as happened with my latest iteration of Django), file uploaders and so on. No DB, write straight to file, upload to server. 

This is built in Gatsby.js, using the <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog">Default Gatsby Blog Starter</a>
