![The Draughtsman Writer](./draughtsman_writer.jpg)

- Started in Wordpress
- Rebuilt in Laravel
- Rebuilt in Django after I decided to shift focus from PHP to Python. Idea was to build the most obvious in new technology as a means to get experience in that technology.
- Found both Laravel and Django cumbersome for just a portfolio, especially when I got serious about wanting to blog. So now shifted to Gatsby, with the hopes of not just writing regularly but focusing exclusively on the front end.
